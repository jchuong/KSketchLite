How to run:
make 	 - compiles and runs
make run - runs the program

How to use:

---------
Draw Mode
---------
On startup, you are in this mode by default.  You can click and drag on
the pad to draw lines as you wish.  Click and drag the slider at the bottom
to change the time/frame you wish to draw in.

Drawing in a frame will show the drawing from that frame until erased.
Drawings in a frame, then going back in time will hide the drawing until
that point in time is reached again (sliding the time slider, starting
the animation).

----------
Erase Mode
----------
Erasing allows you to click and drag around the drawing area, removing
any line that intersects with the line you are creating as you erase.
Erasing removes the line from that from until the end of time.

-----------
Select Mode
-----------
Selection mode allows you to draw a line(shape) that encompasses one or more lines
If the lines are fully encompassed, then the lines are selected and can be
manipulated by holding shift and dragging them. 
This animates them across the next frames

Selected lines are highlighted in blue.  To unselect lines, change modes.

Selected lines can be MOVED by HOLDING SHIFT and dragging the mouse.

The same as Erase, but instead clears the whole screen instead
of selecting individual lines.

------------
Pause Button
------------
Pauses the animation.  This states is automatically switched to
if you attempt to draw, erase, clear frames, etc.
